RedModel
========

RedModel is a Model Definition Layer written on top of [RedBean][1].

RedModel is in currently in early stages of development, although it 
should be more or less in working condition. The eventual goal is to 
provide django-like functionality on top of the RedBean ORM framework.

Stay tuned for more details...
